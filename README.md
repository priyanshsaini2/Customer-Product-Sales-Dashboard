# Customer Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project designed to analyze and visualize customer sales data. The goal of this project is to provide an interactive and insightful overview of business performance through key sales metrics, customer behavior, product trends, and regional distribution.

The dashboard allows business stakeholders, sales teams, and data analysts to make informed decisions by offering a clear view of how sales are distributed across channels, regions, and time periods.

## Key Features

### 1. High-Level Metrics

The top section of the dashboard displays essential KPIs such as:

* **Total Revenue** generated over the selected time frame.
* **Total Cost** incurred.
* **Total Quantity** of products sold.

These indicators provide a quick snapshot of business health.

### 2. Sales by Channel

A pie chart visualizes the contribution of different sales channels:

* Wholesale
* Distributor
* Export

This helps in understanding which channels are driving the most revenue and volume.

### 3. Order Quantity by Region

A horizontal bar chart shows the sum of order quantities across top-performing regions or cities. This enables geographic analysis and helps identify strong or weak regional markets.

### 4. Top Revenue by City

An interactive map highlights cities that contribute the most to total revenue. This spatial visualization assists in identifying high-revenue zones for targeted strategies.

### 5. Top Customers

A bar chart ranking the top six customers by revenue. This is useful for evaluating key client relationships and customer lifetime value.

### 6. Best-Selling Products

A horizontal bar chart displays the top six products by revenue. It highlights which products are the main revenue drivers.

### 7. Quantity Margin Products

A grid showing products with the highest order quantities, helping to understand product demand independent of revenue.
